# Project: Root Beer

Project Root Beer is an algorithm that develops specialized root finder algorithms for given equations. This is done using a combination of symbolic regression (using simulated annealing and differentiable Cartesian Genetic Programming) and symbolic computer algebra systems (using black magic).

# Restrictions and assumptions
 - Only Python 3.x support
 - Only functions with scalar output are supported
